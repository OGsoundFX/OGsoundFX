- My name is Olivier Girardot.
- I graduated from the **Lewagon coding bootcamp** in March 2020, after 2 months of intensive but soooo inspiring bootcamp ðŸš€
- Before that I worked as a statistician in a health insurance company in Paris for 5 years. I realised very quickly that this wasn't the career I was looking for. **Music** had always been my true passion, so I went for it.
- In 2008 I moved to **Berlin** with my wife, after we had both quit our jobs ðŸ™€. My new career as a **freelance music composer and sound designer** took off nicely, and 12 years after I felt like doing something new again: **learn to code!** So I joined Lewagon! I then became **Teacher Assistant** for a while, found a job as **software engineer in a startup** for a year, and now I'm back TA-ing at Lewagon again, YAY ðŸŽ‰ !!!

On the side I have been working on a couple of personal projects:
- **BAMSFX** my online Sound Effects shop built with **Ruby on Rails**: **[HERE](https://www.bamsfx.com)**
- **The Quest** a small WIP game that I made mostly to train with **NodeJS/ExpressJS** and **MongoDB**: **[The Quest](https://thequest-bamsfx.herokuapp.com/)**
