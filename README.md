My name is Olivier Girardot, I graduated from Lewagon in March 2020, after 2 months of intensive but soooo inspiring bootcamp ðŸš€ Before that I worked as a statistician in a health insurance company in Paris for 5 years. I realised very quickly that this wasn't the career I was looking for. Music had always been my true passion, so I went for it. In 2008 I moved to Berlin with my wife, after we had both quit our jobs ðŸ™€. My new career as a freelance music composer and sound designer took off nicely, and 12 years after I felt like doing something new again: learn to code! So I joined Lewagon! I then became TA for a couple of batches, found a job as software engineer in a startup for a year, and now I'm back TA-ing at Lewagon again, YAY ðŸŽ‰ !!!
